# Add a declarative step here for populating the DB with movies.

Given /the following movies exist/ do |movies_table|
  movies_table.hashes.each do |movie|
    Movie.create(title: movie[:title], rating: movie[:rating], release_date: movie[:release_date])
  end
end

Then /(.*) seed movies should exist/ do | n_seeds |
  expect(Movie.count).to eq n_seeds.to_i
end

# Make sure that one string (regexp) occurs before or after another one
#   on the same page

Then /I should see "(.*)" before "(.*)"/ do |e1, e2|
  #  ensure that that e1 occurs before e2.
  #  page.body is the entire content of the page as a string.
  expect(page.body).to match(/#{e1}[.\s\S]*#{e2}/) 
  # pending "Fill in this step in movie_steps.rb"
end

# Make it easier to express checking or unchecking several boxes at once
#  "When I uncheck the following ratings: PG, G, R"
#  "When I check the following ratings: G"

When /I (un)?check the following ratings: (.*)/ do |uncheck, rating_list|
  ratings_splitted = rating_list.split(', ')
  ratings_splitted.each do |rating|
    if uncheck
      uncheck("#{rating}")
    else
      check("#{rating}")
    end
  end
end

# Part 2, Step 3
Then /^I should (not )?see the following movies: (.*)$/ do |no, movie_list|
  # Take a look at web_steps.rb Then /^(?:|I )should see "([^"]*)"$/
  movies_splitted = movie_list.split(', ')
  movies_splitted.each do |movie|
    if no
      expect(page).not_to have_content("#{movie}")
    else
      expect(page).to have_content("#{movie}")
    end
  end
end

Then /I should see all the movies/ do
  rows = Movie.count
  expect(rows).to eq 10
end

### Utility Steps Just for this assignment.

Then /^debug$/ do
  # Use this to write "Then debug" in your scenario to open a console.
   require "byebug"; byebug
  1 # intentionally force debugger context in this method
end

Then /^debug javascript$/ do
  # Use this to write "Then debug" in your scenario to open a JS console
  page.driver.debugger
  1
end


Then /complete the rest of of this scenario/ do
  # This shows you what a basic cucumber scenario looks like.
  # You should leave this block inside movie_steps, but replace
  # the line in your scenarios with the appropriate steps.
  fail "Remove this step from your .feature files"
end
